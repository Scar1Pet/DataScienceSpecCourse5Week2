## Course 5, Week 2, Peer Review Assignment 1

This repo contains files and information to complete the requirements of this peer review assignment. This repo contains 4 key files.  
*Note: The only file you will probably need to review to evaluate my work is 'activity.html.'* 

1. `activity.html`  -- A HTML presentation of the R code, output, and analysis that fulfills the requirements of the assignment. This file was generated using the knitr package in RStudio (R version 3.4.0). 

2. `activity.Rmd` -- The R Markdown file used to generate activity.html

2. `course5week2peer1.R` -- The condensed source code used in activity.html, all of which may be found and reviewed in that file. Since activity.html already contains extensive commenting, this source file is lightly commented, and merely organized by task. The source file is included and may be more useful for anyone wishing to evaluate my code in R directly, instead of copying and pasting the code chunks, one at a time, from activity.html.

3. `activity.csv` -- The raw data used for this assignment. The data may also be [downloaded here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip).
