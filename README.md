# Coursera: Data Science Specialization
## Course 5, Week 2, Peer Review Assignment 1

This repo contains data from 5 files to complete the requirements of this peer review assignment.  
*Note: The only file you will probably need to review and evaluate my work is `activity.html`.* 

**IMPORTANT**  
Please remember that Github can not properly convert the activity.Rmd to HTML. Unfortunately, Github does not appear able to load the `activity.html` file directly into your browser for easy viewing. The *easiest way* to view my report will be to follow this link to the github HTML preview webtool: [http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Scar1Pet/DataScienceSpecCourse5Week2/blob/master/activity.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Scar1Pet/DataScienceSpecCourse5Week2/blob/master/activity.html)  

If you want to use that link in the future for your own work, simply follow this link: [http://htmlpreview.github.io/](http://htmlpreview.github.io/)  
If that does not work, to view the report the way it was intended, please click the "Clone or download" green button, and save the contents of this repo to a .zip file. Open the activity.html file, and your web browser should then display the report correctly. 

### Repo Contents

1. `activity.html`  -- A HTML presentation of the R code, output, and analysis that fulfills the requirements of the assignment. This file was generated using the knitr package in RStudio (R version 3.4.0). 

2. `activity.Rmd` -- The R Markdown file used to generate `activity.html`

3. `course5week2peer1.R` -- The condensed source code used in `activity.html`, all of which may be found and reviewed in that file. Since `activity.html` already contains extensive commenting, this source file is lightly commented, and merely organized by task. The source file is included and may be more useful for anyone wishing to evaluate my code in R directly, instead of copying and pasting the code chunks, one at a time, from `activity.html`.

4. `activity.csv` -- The raw data used for this assignment. The data may also be [downloaded here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip).

5. `README.md` -- This file
